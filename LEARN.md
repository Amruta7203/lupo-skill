# Lupo Skill

<br/>

## Project Description:

Lupo Skill is an open-source platform where people can share their skills through various events. Users have the flexibility to both host their own events and join others to exchange knowledge and learn new things. The platform is developed using React.js with TypeScript for frontend magic, Firebase for robust backend services, and React-Bootstrap for a polished user interface.

## Why didi I select these technologies?

- **TypeScript :** I used typescript because of its numerous advantages.
  - TypeScript introduces static typing, making code more readable and understandable.
  - TypeScript's type checking catches errors during development, providing feedback before runtime. This helps in identifying and fixing issues early in the development process, leading to more stable and reliable code.
  - With TypeScript, developers can define clear interfaces and types, making code maintenance easier.

- **React Bootstrap :** With React Bootstrap, we're able to create a responsive and visually appealing interface. It's like having a style guide that makes everything work well across different devices.

- **Firebase :** Firebase, being maintained by Google, offers reliable backend services with frequent updates and ample documentation to guide development.
   
  - **Firebase-auth :** I used firebase-auth because it provides google SignIn/SignUp feature.
  - **Firebase-RTDB :** Firebase RTDB (Real-time database) provides a JSON like data structure which makes it easier to retrive and store data with lesser read costs. _Example-_

  - **Firebase-storage :** Firebase Storage provides a safe and efficient way to store files like images. I used Firebase storage to store the user banners, and the event banners.
